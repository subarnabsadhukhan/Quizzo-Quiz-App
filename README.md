# Quizzo - Quiz App

***A simple Quiz App to test your basic knowledge on Flutter.***

Hi, I am Subarnab Sadhukhan. This is my Second Project on Google Flutter. This Quiz app is Android and Web ready.

*Check out the Web App version:* **[https://qr.subarnab.in/quizzo](https://qr.subarnab.in/quizzo)**

> **Note :** <br>
> I have pushed all the Commits 'as it is'. I built this app when I was learning Flutter. When I learned something new or changed something on this project, I made a Commit. So, most of these Commits are not made according to the concept ofÂ Atomic Commit.
